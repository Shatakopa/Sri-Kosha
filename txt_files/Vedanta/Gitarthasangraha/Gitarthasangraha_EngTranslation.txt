The Bhagavad Gita declares Narayana as the Supreme Brahman, who can only be attained through Bhakti, supported by Dharma, knowledge, and detachment.

The first six chapters emphasize performing selfless actions (Karma) and gaining wisdom (Jnana), along with Yoga, to realize the true self.

The middle six chapters focus on Bhakti Yoga, cultivated through Karma and Jnana, to attain precise knowledge of the Supreme Being.

The final six chapters discuss matter in its primal and evolved states, the individual self, and the Supreme Lord, while further elaborating on work, knowledge, and devotion.

The Gita was spoken for Arjuna, who was confused about Dharma and Adharma, and sought Krishna’s guidance.

The second chapter explains Sankhya and Yoga to remove Arjuna’s delusion by teaching about the eternal self and selfless action.

The third chapter teaches selfless work, dedicating actions to the Lord, and understanding the role of the three Gunas in all activities.

The fourth chapter explains the divine nature of Krishna, the knowledge aspect of Karma Yoga, its different forms, and the superiority of wisdom.

The fifth chapter highlights the ease and effectiveness of Karma Yoga and its role in realizing the true nature of the self.

The sixth chapter discusses Yoga practice, its four types of practitioners, and the supremacy of Yoga in attaining the Lord.

The seventh chapter reveals Krishna’s true nature, how He is hidden by Prakriti, and the importance of surrendering to Him.

The eighth chapter distinguishes between devotees seeking material wealth, self-realization, or complete surrender to the Lord.

The ninth chapter describes Krishna’s divine supremacy, the excellence of devoted souls, and the significance of Bhakti Yoga.

The tenth chapter expands on Krishna’s infinite divine attributes and absolute control, deepening Bhakti among seekers.

The eleventh chapter states that Arjuna was granted divine vision to see Krishna’s universal form, proving Bhakti as the only way to know Him.

The fifteenth chapter declares Krishna as distinct from the individual self and matter, as He pervades, sustains, and rules all.

The sixteenth chapter contrasts divine and demonic qualities, stressing the importance of following the scriptures for truth and righteous conduct.

The seventeenth chapter categorizes various religious practices based on the Gunas and explains the significance of the sacred syllables "Om," "Tat," and "Sat."

The eighteenth chapter discusses surrendering agency to the Lord, cultivating Sattvic qualities, and Bhakti Yoga as the essence of the Gita’s teachings.

Karma Yoga involves self-discipline, pilgrimage, charity, and sacrifice, while Jnana Yoga is about abiding in the purified self.

Bhakti Yoga means worshipping the Supreme with unwavering love, interconnected with Karma and Jnana Yoga.

All three Yogas involve prescribed duties as acts of worship. Bhakti Yoga can be practiced even before self-realization through chanting, singing, and visiting holy places.

When ignorance is removed and one sees the self as subordinate to Krishna, supreme devotion arises, leading to His divine abode.

Bhakti Yoga grants prosperity, sovereignty, or self-realization, depending on one's desires, including Kaivalya (liberation).

All devotees accept Krishna as the ultimate goal, but those exclusively devoted to Him attain Him fully.

The Jnani (wise devotee) depends entirely on Krishna, finding joy in His presence and sorrow in separation.

True devotion is when all senses and thoughts remain absorbed in Krishna, with meditation, speech, and actions dedicated to Him.

All spiritual disciplines should be performed solely for Krishna’s pleasure, abandoning dependence on any means other than Him.

Such a devotee finds complete happiness in serving Krishna and ultimately attains His divine realm. This is the essence of the Gita.
